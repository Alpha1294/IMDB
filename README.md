### üèÖ About This project : Is using a database from kaggle of 1000 movie titles and get some usefull insights.
- The data needed some cleaning and wrangleling before we could answer some questions.
  ## How have movie genres evolved over the years?

  ## Analyze trends in genre popularity across different time periods. Is there a correlation between a movie's IMDB rating and its box office gross?
  - I separated the movies in 3 groups of years so i can avoid a bit the inflation, obviously not the same money youcould win with a movie in 1950 than in 2020

  ## Determine if higher-rated movies tend to earn more at the box office. Does a higher Meta_score correlate with a higher IMDB rating?

  ## Examine the relationship between critic scores and audience ratings. What is the distribution of movie certificates (ratings), and how do they affect IMDB ratings?

  ## Lets go for the last question, which directs have the best ratings? And since we love top tens ,lets go with one of directors by ratings earned.
